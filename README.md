This is the Snake Game, a classic arcade-style game designed in Python with turtle graphics.
The objective is to guide the snake to eat the food while avoiding the walls and its own body. 
The score increases with each food eaten, and the speed increases with each level. 
The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
